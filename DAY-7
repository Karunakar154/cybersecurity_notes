# 🔐 Day 7 – Password Cracking, Network Attacks, Forensics & Cloud Security

---

## 🔑 1. Password Cracking and Hashing

### 🔹 What is Hashing?
Hashing is a **one-way function** that converts data into a fixed-length string. Used for password storage.

### 🔹 Common Hash Algorithms:
- MD5 – Fast but weak (easily cracked)
- SHA-1 – Better than MD5, but still weak
- SHA-256 – Secure and used widely

### 🔹 Tools for Hashing:
```bash
echo -n "password123" | md5sum
echo -n "password123" | sha256sum

🔹 Password Cracking Methods:
Type	Description
Brute Force	- Try every possible combination
Dictionary Attack- 	Use a list of common passwords
Hybrid Attack	- Dictionary + random characters
Rainbow Tables	- Precomputed hashes for fast cracking
🔹 Tools:
John the Ripper – Fast offline cracking

Hashcat – GPU-accelerated password recovery

Hydra – Online brute-force tool (SSH, FTP, HTTP)
 2. Wireshark and Network Testing
🔹 What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a GUI-based network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets in real-time.

🔹 Key Features:
Capture live network traffic

Filter and analyze packets

Detect protocols and services

🔹 Common Filters:
Filter	Description
ip.addr == x.x.x.x	Filter by IP
tcp.port == 80	Filter by port
http	View HTTP traffic
dns	View DNS queries

🔹 Use Cases:
Capture login credentials (if unencrypted)

Analyze suspicious network traffic

Troubleshoot connectivity
 3. Wireless Network Hacking
🔹 Targets:
Wi-Fi (WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPA3)

Access Points

Weak passwords

🔹 Tools:
aircrack-ng suite

airmon-ng – Enable monitor mode

airodump-ng – Capture packets

aireplay-ng – Deauth attack

aircrack-ng – Crack handshake

Wifite – Automated wireless attack tool

Kismet – Wireless network detector/sniffer

🔹 Cracking WPA2 WiFi:
bash
Copy
Edit
airmon-ng start wlan0
airodump-ng wlan0mon
aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture.cap
4. Digital Forensics
🔹 What is Digital Forensics?
The process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence.

🔹 Forensics Process:
Identification – Find the data source

Preservation – Maintain integrity (write blockers)

Analysis – Examine data

Documentation & Reporting

🔹 Tools:
Autopsy/Sleuth Kit – GUI forensic suite

FTK Imager – Imaging and preview

Volatility – Memory forensics

ExifTool – Metadata extraction

X-Ways – Professional digital investigation suite

🔹 Use Cases:
Investigating cyber crimes

Recovering deleted files

Tracing intrusions and malware
5. Cloud Computing and Security (AWS & Azure)
🔹 Cloud Computing Models:
Model	Example	Description
IaaS	AWS EC2, Azure VM	Infrastructure as a Service
PaaS	AWS Elastic Beanstalk	Platform as a Service
SaaS	Gmail, Office365	Software as a Service

🔹 Cloud Security Concerns:
Misconfigured buckets (S3, Azure Blob)

Unauthorized access

Insecure APIs

Identity and Access Management (IAM)

🔹 AWS Security Features:
IAM roles and policies

CloudTrail (logging)

GuardDuty (threat detection)

Security Groups / NACLs

🔹 Azure Security Tools:
Azure Defender

Azure Policy

Key Vault

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
6. TOR, Anonymous & Proxy Services
🔹 TOR (The Onion Router):
Encrypts traffic in layers

Anonymizes source IP

Access to .onion websites (Dark Web)

Usage:

Use Tor Browser

Routes traffic via multiple nodes

Caution: Not fully secure without good OPSEC.

🔹 Anonymous Services:
Tails OS – Live OS for anonymity

VPNs – Encrypt traffic, hide IP

I2P – Invisible Internet Project (peer-to-peer anonymity)

🔹 Proxy Services:
Type	Description
HTTP Proxy	Masks IP, basic filtering
SOCKS Proxy	Works with all types of traffic
Transparent Proxy	No user interaction, often for filtering

Tools:

ProxyChains

Tor + VPN

Burp Suite for manual proxying
